title: Antilibrary
---

A collection of unread books. Got the idea from https://jzhao.xyz/books. Nassim
Nicholas Taleb was the first to coin the phrase in his book _The Black Swan_:

> The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are
> encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull. He is the owner of a large personal
> library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two
> categories: those who react with “Wow! Signore professore dottore Eco, what a
> library you have! How many of these books have you read?”\* and the others—a
> very small minority—who get the point that a private library is not an
> ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable
> than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know
> as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate
> market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more
> books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves
> will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of
> unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.
