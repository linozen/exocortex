### Eco's Four Rules for Choosing a Thesis Topic

1.  _The topic should reflect your previous studies and experience_. In other
    words, do something that you care about and that pertains to your political
    or cultural experience.
2.  _The necessary sources should be materially accessible_. Is there material
    that I can conveniently access in order to research my chosen topic.
3.  _The necessary sources should be manageable_. Do you have the time, ability
    and experience to understand the sources.
4.  _You should have some experience with the methodological framework that you
    will use in the thesis_.
