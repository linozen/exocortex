## Why does a correlation of 0.20 only explain 4% of the observed variance?

The correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of a linear
relationship between two variables. However, to determine the proportion of the
variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent
variable(s), we use the coefficient of determination (r-squared).

The r-squared value is found by squaring the correlation coefficient. So if we
have a correlation of 0.20, we square this value (0.20 \* 0.20 = 0.04 or 4%) to
get our r-squared value. This means that only 4% of the total variation in y can
be explained by the linear relationship between x and y.

It is important to note that a low r-squared value does not necessarily mean
there is no relationship between the variables or that a model is not useful. It
simply means that most of the variation in y remains unexplained by x using a
linear model.

Also, while r-squared gives us an indication of how well our model fits our
data, it should not be used alone for assessing model fit or comparing models as
it does not take into account overfitting or complexity of models.
