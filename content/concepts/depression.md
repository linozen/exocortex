## Let yourself become Depressed

Depression (and how we accept and overcome it) thus links to

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) are two of the most widely used
classification systems for mental health disorders, including major depression.
While they have a lot in common, there are some key differences in how they
define major depression.

## ICD-10

In the ICD-10, Major Depression is classified under "Depressive Episode" (codes
F32-F33). The diagnosis requires at least two out of three typical symptoms:

1. Depressed mood
2. Loss of interest or pleasure
3. Reduced energy or increased fatigueability

Additionally, at least two out of seven other symptoms should be present, such
as:

- Reduced concentration and attention
- Reduced self-esteem and self-confidence
- Ideas of guilt and unworthiness
- Bleak and pessimistic views of the future
- Ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide
- Disturbed sleep
- Diminished appetite

## DSM-5

In the DSM-5, Major Depressive Disorder (code 296.2x/296.3x) requires at least
five symptoms to be present during the same 2-week period and represent a change
from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms should be either:

1. Depressed mood
2. Loss of interest or pleasure

Other symptoms include:

- Significant weight loss or gain, or decrease or increase in appetite
- Insomnia or hypersomnia
- Psychomotor agitation or retardation
- Fatigue or loss of energy
- Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
- Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness
- Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific
  plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide

In summary, while both ICD-10 and DSM-5 require the presence of a depressed mood
and/or loss of interest or pleasure for the diagnosis of major depression, the
number and type of additional symptoms required differ between the two systems.
