title: Discipline
description: Foucault's understanding of disciplinary modes of power
---

## Definition in Foucault

> 'Discipline' may be identified neither with an institution nor with an
> apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, comprising a
> whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application,
> targets; it is a 'physics' or an 'anatomy' of power, a technology
> [@foucault1975, 215].

> Let us say that discipline is the unitary technique by which the body is
> reduced as a 'political' force at the least cost and maximized as a useful
> force. The growth of a capitalist economy gave rise to the specific modality
> of disciplinary power, whose general formulas, techniques of submitting forces
> and bodies, in short, 'political anatomy', could be operated in the most
> diverse political regimes, apparatuses or institutions [@foucault1975, 221]
