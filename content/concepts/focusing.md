**Focusing** is a psychotherapeutic process developed by psychotherapist Eugene
Gendlin. It involves a person directly "tapping into" their body's knowledge and
wisdom to help resolve issues or make decisions. This is done by paying
attention to what Gendlin calls the "felt sense", a physical sensation that
corresponds to emotions or thoughts. This "felt sense" is never clear at first.
It emerges from an inner murkiness one has to confront.

The process of focusing can be broken down into six steps: clearing a space,
getting a felt sense, finding a handle, resonating and checking, asking, and
receiving. These steps allow the person to get in touch with their inner self,
understand their feelings better, and find solutions to problems.

Clearing a space involves setting aside all preoccupations and worries. Getting
a felt sense involves paying attention to the body's physical sensations that
are associated with particular issues or concerns. Finding a handle means
finding words or images that accurately capture these sensations.

Resonating and checking involve going back and forth between the handle and the
felt sense to see if they resonate with each other. Asking involves asking
open-ended questions about what the felt sense means. Receiving involves
accepting whatever answers come up without judging them.

Focusing is often used in combination with other therapeutic techniques such as
psychoanalysis or cognitive-behavioral therapy. It can help people deal with
issues such as anxiety, depression, stress, trauma, and relationship problems.
