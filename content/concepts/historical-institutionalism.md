Historical Institutionalism (HI) developed in response to
[[structural-functionalism]] which was wondering about institutional
inefficiencies. If, as assumed, the world was a complex system gravitating
towards a steady state, why did dysfunctional institutions persist. Hence,

## Definition of International Institutions (IIs)

HI has as an expansive and textured understanding of which institutions matter
and how they matter [@hall1996, 937]. IIs are humanly devised rule systems that
structure and constrain the behaviour of individual actors.

For historical institutionalists, IIs are:

> the formal or informal procedures, routines, norms and conventions embedded in
> the organizational structure of the polity or political economy. They can
> range from the rules of a constitutional order or the standard operating
> procedures of a bureaucracy to the conventions governing trade union behaviour
> or bank-firm relations. In general, historical institutionalists associate
> institutions with organizations and the rules or conventions promulgated by
> formal organization. [@hall1996, 938]

## The role of timing and sequencing in institutional development

HI emphasises the importance of timing and sequencing in institutional
development. The order in which events occur can shape the trajectory of an
institution, creating path dependencies that can be difficult to reverse. For
example, the establishment of a particular policy can create vested interests
that resist change, even when new circumstances arise.

## The impact of critical junctures on institutional change

Critical junctures are moments of significant change that can disrupt existing
paths and create new ones. HI argues that these junctures can lead to rapid
institutional transformation, as they provide opportunities for actors to push
for reform. However, the impact of

these junctures can be limited by existing institutional structures and power
relations. This is because these structures and relations often dictate the
direction of change, and can constrain or facilitate the implementation of new
policies or reforms.

## The role of historical legacies in shaping institutions

Historical legacies are another key concept in HI. They refer to the enduring
impact of past events, decisions, and processes on current institutions. They
shape institutions by influencing their rules, norms, and practices. For
example, a country’s colonial history might influence its current political
system or economic policies.

## Institutional resilience and change

Institutions are not static; they evolve over time in response to various
internal and external pressures. However, HI posits that institutions also
exhibit a certain degree of resilience – they tend to resist radical changes and
instead evolve incrementally. This resilience is partly due to their inherent
path dependency – once an institution is established along a certain path, it
becomes difficult to alter its course.

## Questions & Answers

### Why is there institutional variation despite similar systemic pressures?

HI seeks to explain why institutions, despite facing similar systemic pressures,
may vary significantly in their structure and function. This is often due to the
historical path dependencies of these institutions, which shape their responses
to external pressures. For instance, two countries with similar economic
conditions may have vastly different political systems due to their unique
historical trajectories.

### Why are institutions are often not as efficient as Rational Choice Institutionalism would predict?

Institutions often do not function as efficiently as Rational Choice
Institutionalism would predict due to historical constraints and path
dependencies. Historical Institutionalism argues that institutions are shaped by
the historical circumstances of their creation and evolution. These historical
legacies may result in institutional inefficiencies, such as outdated practices
or entrenched power structures, which can hinder optimal decision-making and
performance.

### Why is there institutional persistence despite preference change?

- Process of institutionalisation (emergence/destruction of institutions after
  so-called critical junctures)
- [Path Dependency]({{< relref "path-dependency" >}}) of institutions (path
  dependency as choice under historical constraints)
