title: Internal Family Systems
---

A type of [[psychotherapy]] which assumes we are born with parts - none of which
are bad. The're necessary for our thriving. They might be forced out of their
naturally helpful states into damaging roles through [[trauma]].

Internal Family Systems (IFS) was founded by Robert Schwarz. There are three
categories/blueprintes for the roles of parts: manager, firefighter, and exile.
The manager role is proactive and protective, trying to keep vulnerable or
exiled parts out of consciousness. The firefighter role is reactive and
desperate, emerging when exiles break out and demand attention. The exile role
contains trauma, often from childhood experiences.

In IFS therapy, the goal is to help individuals access their Self - a core,
compassionate essence - and from that Self-energy, heal their wounded parts.

IFS therapy is effective for treating a variety of mental health conditions
including depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
eating disorders and addiction.
