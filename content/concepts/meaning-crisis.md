title: Meaning crisis
---

Term coined by [John Vervaeke](https://johnvervaeke.com/) to describe a sense of
disconnection (from self and others) and the preponderance of [[bullshit]].

Definition from the
[Vervaeke Foundation](https://vervaekefoundation.org/what-is-the-meaning-crisis/):

> We are in the midst of a mental health crisis. There are increases in anxiety
> disorders, depression, despair, and suicide rates are going up in North
> America, parts of Europe, and other parts of the world. This mental health
> crisis is itself due to, and engaged with, crises in the environment and the
> political system, those in turn are enmeshed within a deeper cultural
> historical crisis that John Vervaeke calls "The Meaning Crisis". It's more and
> more pervasive throughout our lives. And there's a sense of drowning in this
> old ocean of bullshit. And we have to understand, why is this the case? And
> what can we do about it? Today, there is an increase of people feeling very
> disconnected from themselves, from each other, from the world, and from a
> viable and foreseeable future.

Not solving the meaning crisis is probably a
