## Why take notes?

Found in [@ahrens2017, 12]:

> "Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary
> physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavor easier, they make it possible
> ... no matter how internal processes are implemented [...you..] need to
> understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding."
> [@levy2011]

And, again the OG of the Zettelkasten method:

> “One cannot think without writing.” [@luhmann1981]
