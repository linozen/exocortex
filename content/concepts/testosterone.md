# Testosterone

There is a
[Huberman Lab](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-sapolsky-science-of-stress-testosterone-and-free-will)
episode with Robert Sapolsky.

Apparently, Sapolsky also wrote a book about it called _The Trouble with
Testosterone_.

## Aggression

According to Sapolsky, testosterone does not **cause** aggression. Rather, it
amplifies already existing aggression. Testosterone is also about defending
challenges to (social) status, which is why, in humans, the link with aggression
is even more tenuous. This is the case because humans have loads of ways to
assert, defend and communicate status (e.g. buying expensive stuff).
