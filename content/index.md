title: Welcome to my brain
---

Welcome to the public part of what I call my **Exocortex**. Here, you can see me
think. At the end, it's really just a bunch of structured markdown files that
help me make sense of the world.

Thinking is a perpetually unfinished process and hence this space is and will
remain indefinitely **work in progress**. Some notes might lack any
sophistication. Most of them are incomplete. If that bothers you, or you want to
start a conversation on some of the topics covered here, feel free to send me a
note at exocortex@sehn.dev, so I know where you found me.

## Getting started

There are various ways to dive into this. The easiest is to use search. Simply
press `Ctrl+K` and start exploring. Another thing: A link like
[this](https://github.com/linozen/exocortex) is an external link (to the GitHub
repo of this project in this case). Links like this (e.g. [[docs]]) are internal
links to other parts in my Exocortex.

You could also dive in by navigating to one of the following index notes:

- Explore my notes on things made by other people. I call them reference notes
  or [[refs/index|refs]] for short.
- Explore my notes on [[concepts]]. Here, you still find lots of stuff made and
  thought by other people, but there's certainly more of my own synthesizing and
  structuring going on.

These two shall remain the only two loose categories for this space. The more
they bleed into another, the better. Everything else is added and then put in
relation to already existing things. No further [[categories]] necessary.

## How does this thing even work?

Check out the [[docs]].

## And what's it for?

Writing helps me think, and I want an excuse to keep doing it publicly. Check
out this quote by the OG of Zettelkasten techniques, Niklas Luhman:

> What are we to do with what we have written down? Certainly, at first, we will
> produce **mostly garbage** (emphasis mine). But we have been educated to
> expect something useful from our activities and soon lose confidence if
> nothing useful seems to result. We should, therefore, reflect on whether and
> how we arrange our notes so that they are available for later access.

This is my space for reflection. I don't intend to publish private text such as
journals (I'm not even sure sometimes whether I should read them again). No,
this public space is reserved for things that I deem useful to others.

## Inspiration

There is list of wonderful Zettelkasten projects over here
[on GitHub](https://github.com/KasperZutterman/Second-Brain). Some of my
favourites are:

- Jethro Kuan's braindump at https://braindump.jethro.dev
- Gwern's legendary https://gwern.net
- Andy Matuschak's working notes over at https://notes.andymatuschak.org
