## What is it?

From the
[official Cambridge website](https://www.psychometrics.cam.ac.uk/productsservices/mypersonality):

> **myPersonality** was a popular Facebook application created by David
> Stillwell in 2007 that allowed users to take real psychometric tests and
> obtain their results instantly. As well as the data from the tests, around 40%
> of the respondents also opted in to share data from their Facebook profile,
> resulting in one of the largest social science research databases in history.
> The application was active until 2012 and collected data from over **6
> million** > **volunteers** during this time. This data was anonymised and
> samples of it were shared with registered academic collaborators around the
> world through the myPersonality project, resulting in over **45 scientific
> publications** in peer-reviewed journals. Respondents came from various age
> groups, backgrounds and cultures. They were highly motivated to answer
> honestly and carefully, as the only gratification they received for their
> participation was feedback on their results. Their scores are combined with
> additional information from those who opted in to sharing it with us,
> including detailed demographic profiles, a record of their social media
> behaviour, their interests, preferences, opinions, etc. The myPersonality
> project is no longer active and data is no longer being shared. See more
> information at [www.mypersonality.org](http://mypersonality.org/)
