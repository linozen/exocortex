## What are AI Surveillance Technologies (AIST)?

The author distinguishes between three types of AI surveillance tools:

1.  Smart city platforms: With the aim of reducing or preventing crime, ensuring
    public safety and responding to emergencies, these platforms often
    incorporate sensors, facial recognition cameras, and police body cameras
    connected to command centres
2.  Smart policing: The use of predictive analytics in order to facilitate
    investigations and police response.
3.  Facial recognition: Biometric technology using cameras to match stored or
    live footage of people with images of their faces from databases.

## Key insights

### AIST spreads fast

At least 75 out of 176 countries globally employ AI-enabled technologies for
surveillance purposes

### China is a major supplier

Chinese suppliers (Huawei, Hikvision and ZTE) provide the most countries with
AIGS (63). 36 of those countries have signed onto China's Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI). More often than not, China incentivises the import of their
surveillance technology by handing out _soft loans_. This is especially relevant
in countries such as Kenya, Laos, Mongolia, Uganda and Uzbekistan that would not
be able to access this technology on their own. While in 2018, 18 our of 65
countries were using Chinese AIST, the AIGS Index shows that the number of
countries having access to Chinese AIST has risen to 47 out of 65.

### China is not the only supplier

China is not the only country that exports advanced surveillance technology.
U.S. firms like IBM (eleven countries), Palantir (nine) and Cisco (six) also
export their mass surveillance products to a worldwide customer base.
Illustrating this point, Feldstein writes:

> Saudi Arabia is a good case in point. Huawei is helping the government build

> BAE has sold mass surveillance systems, NEC is vending facial recognition
> cameras, and Amazon and Alibaba both have cloud computing centers in Saudi
> Arabia and may support a major smart city project. 31 The index shows that
> repressive countries rarely procure such technology from a single source.

### Liberal Democracies are major users of AIST

Following the _Varieties of Democracy_ regime category typology
([LÃ¼hrmann et al. 2019](#orgf9f4edd)), 51% of advanced democracies, 41% of
electoral autocratic/competitive autocratic states, 41 percent of electoral
democracies/illiberal democracies and 37% of closed autocracies have deployed AI
surveillance systems.

### Military Expenditure and the use of AIGS

Forty of the world's top fifty military spending countries (cumulative) also use
AI surveillance technology.

## Critique

Feldstein argues that "AI surveillance technology is 'value neutral'. In and of
themselves, these tools do not foment repression, and their presence does not
mean that a government is using them for antidemocratic purposes". I find this
problematic. Technology is never _neutral_ in the sense that is free from the
embedded scripts that structure its use. Technology is always developed by
somebody for a particular (political) purpose. While one can repurpose
technology to a very limited extent (e.g. a gun won't be able to heal a wound;
it can just create one), it seems impossible to strip it of all the scripts that
its creator(s) endowed it with. Hence, technology, from the moment of its
creation until the moment of its demise, remains (more or less) tethered to its
initial teleology.
