In this seminal book, Michel Foucault analyses the transformations in the way
people are looked over and punished in Western European states. Based on
extensive archival research focusing on French writers from the 18th and 19th
century, Foucault tries to understand how punishment morphed from a brutal
spectacle into a measured, scientific enterprise. He opens the book by
contrasting the extreme brutality of the public torture of regicide Damiens in
1757 with the time-tables of a Parisian prison eighty years later. In a
nutshell, the rest of the book is about tracing this gradual but profound
development. Throughout this genealogical exercise, Foucault draws on and
further develops important but often complex notions such as _discourse_,
_discipline_, _panoptic surveillance_ and aforementioned _normalisation_. To
this day, the book continues to have a noticeable impact, especially on newer
interdisciplinary fields such as surveillance studies.
