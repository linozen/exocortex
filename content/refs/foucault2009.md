This book is derived from Foucault's lectures at the _Coll√®ge de France_ in
1977-78. In these lectures, and especially in the fourth lecture, he develops
one of the central themes of this course, namely _gouvernmentality_. Given the
popularity of this concept in the social sciences today, it is fair to say that
this fourth lecture, in which Foucault attempts something like a definition of
gouvernmentality, is one of his most popular and fruitful contributions.
Fundamentally, Foucault revises some of his earlier work (see his update to the
notion of _normalisation_ above), in order to map the development of the
dominant modes of power. First, a transformation from a _society of sovereignty_
to a _society of discipline_ and then to what he calls a "society of discipline
by a society of government [...] which has population as its main target and
apparatuses of security as its essential mechanism" (p. 107f)
