title: References

This is the index page for my references notes. These notes generally don't
express my own thinking but aim to summarize and make available what I found
interesting about the thinking of others. Hence, the source material can be
(audio)books, articles, blog posts, university lectures, movies or anything else
I found interesting. This page is an index of those notes alongside links to the
source material.

If you wonder where I find the stuff that ends up here, take a look at my
[[input-channels]].

### The proces

Roughly, my note-taking process is as follows:

1. I find interesting material, and it goes on a list that I keep in the private
   part of the Exocortex. See [[docs#Input layer]].
2. Slowly but surely, I then process (see [[docs#Processing layer]]) the
   literature (this can be anything from regular books to articles, podcasts and
   videos)
3. Finally, when I'm done with processing, I publish my notes and link to them
   from this page which serves as an overview
